# BABS scripts for the NIDM BIDS Apps

This repository runs three NIDM-emitting BIDS Apps — [FreeSurfer](https://github.com/ReproNim/freesurfer-nidm_bidsapp), [ANTs](https://github.com/ReproNim/ants-nidm_bidsapp), and [MRIQC](https://github.com/sensein/mriqc-nidm_bidsapp) — over a DataLad study dataset on a SLURM cluster, using [BABS](https://github.com/PennLINC/babs) to manage one job per subject.

Each app has a thin wrapper script; everything they share lives in `babs_common.sh`. A wrapper takes a site through the whole launch sequence in one command: it finds the container image, builds a DataLad container dataset, fills in the app's YAML config, runs `babs init`, and submits one SLURM job per subject. You then wait for the jobs, resubmit any preemption casualties, and harvest the results with the study's own post-processing script.

```bash
./freesurfer-nidm_babs_script.sh Caltech study-ABIDE
```

This exact pipeline produced the 38-subject Caltech FreeSurfer derivative in `study-ABIDE/site-Caltech/derivatives/babs-freesurfer-nidm`, so every step below is validated end to end.

## How the pieces fit together

The scripts expect a study dataset laid out the way the SIMPLE2 DataLad tree is:

```
<DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>/
├── sourcedata/raw          # the BIDS input dataset
├── derivatives/nidm_4.5.0  # existing per-subject NIDM records the apps augment
├── derivatives/babs-<app>  # <- a run creates this (the BABS project)
└── code/post_babs.sh       # the study's harvest script (see Post-processing)
```

Three kinds of storage are involved, and they are deliberately separate:

- **The study tree** (`DATALAD_SET_DIR`) holds the inputs and receives the finished BABS project. This is the durable, shared location.
- **Scratch** (`SCRATCH_DIR_*`) holds each run's working copy of the config, the container DataLad dataset, and the run log. Disposable after harvest.
- **Compute space** (`SCRATCH_DIR_COMPUTE`) is where the individual SLURM jobs clone, run, and zip their results. BABS cleans up after successful jobs.

Create a `.env` file in the project directory (a working template is provided
as `.env` in the repo; copy/adjust it as needed). Use **valid bash syntax** —
no spaces around `=`, and quote any paths containing spaces:

```bash
BASE_DIR='/path/of/current/repo/' # e.g., '/home/yibei/simple2_bidsapp_babs'
SCRATCH_DIR='/path/to/your/output/' # e.g., '/orcd/scratch/bcs/001/yibei/simple2'

# App-specific scratch directories (used by the wrapper scripts)
SCRATCH_DIR_ANTS="${SCRATCH_DIR}/ants_bidsapp_babs"
SCRATCH_DIR_FS="${SCRATCH_DIR}/fs_bidsapp_babs"
SCRATCH_DIR_MRIQC="${SCRATCH_DIR}/mriqc_bidsapp_babs"

SCRATCH_DIR_COMPUTE='/path/to/your/computespace' # e.g., '/orcd/scratch/bcs/001/yibei/'
DATALAD_SET_DIR='/path/to/your/input/data/' # e.g., '/orcd/data/satra/002/datasets/simple2_datalad'
```

(`environment_hpc.yml` ships in this repo; it is BABS's own HPC environment file.) The wrappers activate the `babs` env by name — set `BABS_ENV` in `.env` if you called yours something else — and refuse to run if the active babs predates 0.5.5, so a stale env fails loudly rather than building a broken project. Once a release containing the layout exists, plain `pip install babs` will do.

### 2. Cluster software

Apptainer (or Singularity) for running the containers, and `git-annex` — the wrappers load the `apptainer` module themselves; git-annex comes with the micromamba env. DataLad is installed by `environment_hpc.yml`.

### 3. The container image

Each wrapper looks for its `.sif` file (e.g. `freesurfer-nidm_bidsapp.sif`) in this repo's directory first, then in a short list of fallback paths. Build the image from the matching app repository (each has a `Singularity` recipe and a `setup.py` helper) and drop it next to the scripts. The expected filenames are set at the top of each wrapper script.

### 4. A `.env` file

The wrappers source `.env` from the **current working directory**, so always run them from this repo's root. It is plain bash (no spaces around `=`), so `$HOME` and friends work. A template — replace `<scratch>` with your cluster's scratch/work filesystem and `<data>` with wherever the study's DataLad tree lives:

```bash
BASE_DIR="$HOME/simple2_bidsapp_babs"                    # where you cloned this repo
SCRATCH_DIR_FS="<scratch>/simple2/fs_bidsapp_babs"       # per-app run dirs + logs
SCRATCH_DIR_ANTS="<scratch>/simple2/ants_bidsapp_babs"
SCRATCH_DIR_MRIQC="<scratch>/simple2/mriqc_bidsapp_babs"
SCRATCH_DIR_COMPUTE="<scratch>"                          # where SLURM jobs execute
DATALAD_SET_DIR="<data>/simple2_datalad"                 # root of the study tree
FS_LICENSE="$HOME/license.txt"                           # FreeSurfer runs only
```

### 5. FreeSurfer license (FreeSurfer runs only)

Get a free license from [the FreeSurfer site](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/registration.html) and point `FS_LICENSE` at it. The wrapper fails fast at launch — not two hours later inside every job — if the variable is unset or the file is missing.

The license cannot be baked into the container image: FreeSurfer licenses are personal (issued per registrant), and the images are shared, so embedding one would redistribute it to every user of the image, which the FreeSurfer license terms don't allow. Binding your own license at runtime is the intended mechanism.

### 6. Git access to datasets you don't own

Shared study trees are routinely operated on by people other than their owner, and git refuses that by default ("dubious ownership"). Allow the paths you'll work with:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory '<DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>'
git config --global --add safe.directory '<DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>/sourcedata/raw'
```

The harvest script checks this up front and prints the exact command when it's missing.

## Running

```bash
# subject-level (the default)
./freesurfer-nidm_babs_script.sh Caltech study-ABIDE
./ants-nidm_babs_script.sh Caltech study-ABIDE
./mriqc-nidm_babs_script.sh Caltech study-ABIDE

# session-level, for multi-session datasets
./freesurfer-nidm_babs_script.sh Brown study-ADHD200 session
```

Where things land:

- **BABS project** (the deliverable): `<DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>/derivatives/babs-<app>` — deliberately **undated**. The project's own git history records when everything happened; a date in the folder name is redundant provenance that would have to be corrected later (and BABS projects can't be renamed after `babs init` — absolute paths are baked in). If a project already exists there, `babs init` refuses, which makes redoing a site an explicit decision rather than an accident.
- **Scratch run dir**: `<SCRATCH_DIR_app>/<study>_<RUN_DATE>/` — config copy, container dataset
- **Log**: `<SCRATCH_DIR_app>/babs_script_<RUN_DATE>_<timestamp>.log` — everything the run printed, survives your terminal

`RUN_DATE` (auto-generated as `YYMMDD`, e.g. `260827`) stamps only these per-attempt items — the scratch run dir, compute space, log file, and SLURM job — never the deliverable.

### Knobs

All optional, all environment variables:

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RUN_DATE=260827` | Pin the per-attempt date stamp instead of auto-generating it. |
| `BABS_OUTPUT_DIR=/path` | Put the project somewhere other than the default `derivatives/babs-<app>` — e.g. for a deliberate second run of a site whose project already exists. Must be decided before `babs init`; the project cannot be renamed afterwards. |
| `BABS_SKIP_CHECK_SETUP=1` | **Currently required for every run.** `babs check-setup` crashes on the PR #369 study layout (it hardcodes a `inputs/data` path that no longer exists). The wrapper prints a reminder when it skips. |
| `BABS_SUBMIT_COUNT=N` | Submit only the first N jobs — a controlled ramp for when an app's memory/time needs are unverified. Measure the first completions, adjust the config, then `babs submit` the rest into the same project. |
| `BABS_LIST_SUB_FILE=/path.csv` | Restrict the project to the subjects in a CSV (single `sub_id` column). For pilots and re-runs. |
| `BABS_ENV=name` | Micromamba env holding babs (default `babs`). |
| `BABS_NIDM_DERIV=name` | Which NIDM derivative under `derivatives/` to augment (default `nidm_4.5.0`). |

## While the jobs run

Check on things from the project directory:

```bash
micromamba activate babs
cd <DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>/derivatives/babs-<app>
babs status
```

Two SLURM realities to know about:

**Preemption is expected.** The configs use `mit_preemptable` (591 nodes, 2-day ceiling) rather than `mit_normal` (50 nodes, 12 h) — more throughput, occasional casualties. Every config also sets `#SBATCH --no-requeue`, and must: the partition requeues preempted jobs under the *same* SLURM id, the job then recomputes the same branch name, and its `mkdir` fails. `--no-requeue` turns preemption into a clean failure that can simply be resubmitted. (Of the 38 Caltech FreeSurfer jobs, 4 were preempted; all completed on resubmission.)

**Resubmission only works after the queue drains.** `babs submit` refuses to run — "There are still jobs running" — while *any* of the project's jobs are pending or running. So when a preemption notice arrives mid-run, there is nothing to do yet. Wait for the whole array to finish, then run one batch round:

```bash
babs status     # refreshes the job table, marks the failures
babs submit     # resubmits exactly the subjects without results
```

Repeat if the resubmitted round itself loses jobs to preemption.

## After the jobs finish: post-processing

**The harvest script lives in the dataset, not in this repo** — `<DATALAD_SET_DIR>/<study>/site-<SITE>/code/post_babs.sh` — and that's deliberate: it's per-site, it's owned by the data manager, and two divergent copies of it is how a study ends up half-harvested.

```bash
micromamba activate babs
<site>/code/post_babs.sh <site>/derivatives/babs-<app>
```

It merges the per-job result branches, syncs the local checkout with the output RIA, fetches and unzips the result zips (one `sub-<id>/` per subject), drops the now-redundant zip content, and commits the site dataset's updated submodule pointer. It is safe to re-run: an interrupted harvest resumes, and an already-harvested project is detected rather than re-fetched.

Failure modes it already handles — the reason not to reimplement it:

- **`git-annex` must be on PATH.** These datasets set `filter.annex.process`, so any checkout or rebase shells out to git-annex; without it, git quietly empties tracked files mid-operation.
- **`babs merge` is not idempotent.** It deletes the `job-*` branches from the output RIA once merged, so a second invocation claims no job ever finished. The script counts the RIA's remaining job branches instead of believing that message.
- **Local and RIA histories diverge routinely** (saving `code/` after submission). The script fast-forwards when possible and auto-replays local commits only when they're confined to `code/`, leaving a timestamped backup ref either way.
- **Incremental harvests work.** Already-extracted subjects are detected by directory, so a re-run after a second batch of jobs extracts only the new subjects instead of re-fetching tens of GB.

There is deliberately **no merged-TTL step**: the deliverable is the per-subject `sub-<id>/nidm.ttl` files, which downstream tools query as a group. Nothing consumes a concatenated `nidm_merge.ttl`, so none is produced.

## Per-app configuration

Each app's YAML config sets its SLURM resources, verified against real runs:

| Config | Resources | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `config_freesurfer-nidm.yaml` | 8 CPUs, 24 GB, 3.5 h | needs `FS_LICENSE`; jobs measured ~2–3 h, ~29 GB peak |
| `config_ants-nidm.yaml` | 8 CPUs, 32 GB, 18 h | joint label fusion dominates the time |
| `config_mriqc-nidm.yaml` | 12 CPUs, 18 GB, 25 min | |

The wrappers substitute the environment-specific values (paths, license, session flag) into a copy of the config at launch; the copy lands in the scratch run directory so every run records exactly what it used.

## Adding a new BIDS App

1. Create `config_<app>-nidm.yaml` (start from an existing one).
2. Create `<app>-nidm_babs_script.sh` from an existing wrapper — the app-specific part is just the block of variables at the top: `APP_NAME`, `SCRATCH_DIR`, `CONTAINER_DS_NAME`, `CONTAINER_NAME`, `SIF_FILENAME`, `SIF_ALT_PATHS`.
3. Add the matching `SCRATCH_DIR_<APP>` to `.env`.

Everything else — argument parsing, container dataset setup, config substitution, init, submit — comes from `babs_common.sh`.
