# chmod -- which only the file's OWNER may do, never a mere group member. The
# net effect is that a collaborator in the right Unix group can read the whole
# derivative but cannot write a single annexed file, which is why the only way
# to contribute was to clone it (the `_pub` clones under site-Caltech).
# With --shared_group, annex creates those directories 2775 instead and any
